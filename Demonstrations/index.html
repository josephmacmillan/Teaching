					<h2>About</h2>
					<h3>Research</h3>
					<h5>Physics is traditionally difficult for students to study but classroom demonstrations particularly aid in students’ understanding of physics concepts. 
					<p> Current physics education research indicates that classroom demonstrations are the most memorable lecture component to students and effective at opposing “physics is too difficult” syndrome. However, demonstrations are shown by Crouch et al. (2004) to be ineffective at helping students gain true understanding, unless they are guided to correct their own misconceptions through interactive learning techniques. The Predict, Observe, Discuss method based on David Kolb’s experiential learning research is shown to be especially pedagogically effective. In the POD method students are given a description of the demonstration, make predictions on what will occur, observe the demonstration, and then discuss the results to solidify their conception. 
					<h3><p><p>What we did</h3>
					<h5> Internet-based pedagogical resources were used to select demonstrations based on effectiveness according to research, i.e. they fit with the POD method and successfully disprove misconceptions. A total of 21 demonstrations were built illustrating topics of either mechanics or electricity and magnetism. Each was designed and constructed with a focus on interactive lectures and pedagogical effectiveness.
